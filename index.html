Project 4 The Arcade Game-
Code reused from the following sources:
The starter code for this project comes from the following [Udacity Memory Game repository](https://github.com/udacity/fend-project-memory-game) by Richard Kalehoff. I forked it to my git repo and cloned it.
Some guidance taken from the [Memory Game Study Jam](https://youtu.be/G8J13lmApkQ?t=9) by Yayha Elharony. Thanks for explaining with such clarity and attention to detail.
Some code from Daniela Kuester https://github.com/DanielaKuester/Udacity-Project03-Memory-Game and the tutorial https://scotch.io/tutorials/how-to-build-a-memory-matching-game-in-javascript by Sandra Israel-Ovirih and W3Schools https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_modals.asp all assisted me to optimise the build of the game bit by bit.
Some code from the walkthrough tutorials by Matthew Cranford at https://matthewcranford.com which where brilliant.-->
